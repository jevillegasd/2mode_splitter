# TE Mode Switch

Data from the characterization of a 2mode y-splitter in Silicon. The compact splitter allows separating the fundamental s-mode (TE0) into the fundamental mode of two output waveguides with equal phase or the first odd s-mode (TE1) into the same output modes but with a phase of 180 deg. Using it, a mode converter was demonstrated using the phase shift between the branches in a Mach Zehnder interferometer, as illustrated in this figure.

The simualtions here provided include only a script to generate multiple variations of the sidewall control points randomly. Such test can be used to analyse the fabrication tolreances of the device. The values stored in the file 'paramaters.txt' correspond ti thge optimized structure.
